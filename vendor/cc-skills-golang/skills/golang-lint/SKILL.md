# Go lint configuration and findings

Start from the project's existing configuration, selected Go version, and actual linter output. Preserve the agreed rule set; resolving a warning does not authorize replacing the configuration or enabling an unrelated suite.

- Check the linter's explanation and the surrounding behavior before applying a fix. Inspect the diff from automatic fixes.
- Scope suppressions to a named linter and explain the local reason. Resource, security, and error-handling warnings need a demonstrated false positive or intentional policy, not a blanket exclusion.
- Treat compiler, formatter, analyzer, generator, and CI compatibility separately when introducing new language syntax.
- Run the applicable lint command in the repository's permitted environment. Recheck after a material fix; passing lint is not proof of runtime correctness.

Use the [linter reference](references/linter-reference.md), [suppression reference](references/nolint-directives.md), or [command and configuration examples](references/practices.md) as needed. The [bundled configuration](assets/.golangci.yml) is an optional starting point for a requested setup, not a requirement for every project.
