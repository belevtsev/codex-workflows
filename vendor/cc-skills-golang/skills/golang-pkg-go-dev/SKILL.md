# Published Go package lookup

Use available godig CLI or MCP capabilities for published package facts: documentation, versions, symbols, examples, licenses, importers, and known vulnerabilities. Pin the requested package/version when possible and retain the source and version in the answer.

Published-index results do not describe local `replace` directives, unpublished source, or actual call sites. A vulnerability associated with a package/version is not proof that the current build reaches it. Use local source or gopls for resolved-build questions and the repository's security workflow for a reachability claim.

Read [godig commands and setup](references/commands.md) for the required operation and [sample output](references/sample-output.md) when interpreting output. Installation and server registration are optional setup steps when in scope, not prerequisites for every lookup; use available official documentation as a fallback. Bound or filter large output, and parallelize only independent read-only lookups.

For tool boundaries, see [tool selection](../golang-how-to/references/tool-selection.md). If a tool fails, report its outcome accurately and prepare an issue summary if useful; submit an external issue only when the user authorized it.
