# Go project layout

Match structure to the requested project and existing conventions. A small program can stay flat. Introduce packages, dependency injection, and layers for actual ownership or reuse needs; a routine setup need not pause for architectural choices already clear from the task.

Keep executable entrypoints and importable packages distinct. Respect `internal` visibility, import-cycle constraints, module paths, and major-version suffixes. For an existing project, directory moves may affect initialization, generated code, external consumers, and build scripts.

- [Directory examples](references/directory-layouts.md): small programs, services, and libraries.
- [Workspace behavior](references/workspaces.md): multiple modules and local replacements.
- [Test layout](references/testing-layout.md): colocated tests, fixtures, and benchmarks.
- [Application configuration](references/config.md): only when Cobra/Viper is chosen.

Create only the files needed for the requested deliverable. Adding a Go project or reorganizing packages does not require agent-configuration changes or additional skill activation. Project guidance, lint setup, and CI are separate deliverables when requested.
