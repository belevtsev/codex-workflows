# Go modernization

Use the project's selected Go version and compatibility requirements as the boundary. Read `go.mod`, relevant workspace/toolchain settings, and existing migration decisions. Check official release notes for the specific replacement when version support or semantics are uncertain.

Modernize the requested scope. Existing code or a dependency warning does not authorize a repository-wide upgrade, new configuration, or a tool installation. Respect existing ignore decisions; record new ones only when that documentation is requested.

For each material rewrite, identify changed semantics: loop capture, error matching, JSON wire behavior, timer behavior, randomness, cleanup, or public API. Keep compatibility-sensitive behavior covered by focused evidence in the repository's permitted environment. A language-version change also needs compatible source tools and CI.

Read [version-specific examples](references/versions.md) for the chosen target, [tooling](references/tooling.md) for an authorized tooling upgrade, or [migration catalog](references/practices.md) for deprecations and prioritization. Do not run `go mod tidy` or tests merely to offer a suggestion.
