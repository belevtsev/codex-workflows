# Go tests for observable behavior

Choose tests for the behavior at risk and the evidence missing from the current task. Follow the repository's commands, toolchain, build tags, and execution environment; examples here do not override them. Honor an explicit prohibition on running tests and report the limit.

- Exercise public behavior and failure contracts, including partial effects, retry, cleanup, and cancellation when those are relevant. Coverage percentages alone do not prove the contract.
- Keep tests independently runnable. Use named subtests when they clarify cases, and bind assertions and cleanup to the correct subtest.
- Parallelize only when state and fixtures are isolated. Process-global changes, environment mutations, and unsafe mocks can invalidate parallel tests.
- Prefer observable synchronization or an injected clock over sleeps. Use version-supported `testing/synctest` for suitable timer/goroutine cases, with separate evidence for real I/O boundaries.
- Verify that regressions fail for the intended reason. Choose focused tests first; race, integration, fuzz, and benchmark runs depend on the changed risk and required repository gates.

Read [test patterns and versioned helpers](references/practices.md) for table tests, synctest, cleanup, fuzzing, and coverage. Use [HTTP testing](references/http-testing.md), [mocking](references/mocking.md), [integration fixtures](references/integration-testing.md), or [timeout helpers](references/helpers.md) only for those mechanisms. Existing scripts and examples remain available through the detailed references.
