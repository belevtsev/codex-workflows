# Go dependency wiring

Use explicit dependencies to make construction and lifecycle understandable. Keep the existing DI choice unless evaluating or changing it is part of the task. Manual constructor injection is often enough; a container is useful only for a concrete graph or lifecycle need.

Keep container access at the composition root. Pass the required dependencies into services rather than passing a service locator. Define ownership of startup failures, partial construction cleanup, shutdown order, scopes, and overrides. Interface boundaries should serve consumers and tests, not merely mirror every concrete type.

Read [manual construction](references/manual-di.md) or the selected library example: [Wire](references/google-wire.md), [dig/Fx](references/uber-dig-fx.md), [samber/do](references/samber-do.md). [Comparison and test examples](references/practices.md) help when choosing or migrating an approach. Consult a library-specific skill only when its API or lifecycle mechanics are actually needed.
