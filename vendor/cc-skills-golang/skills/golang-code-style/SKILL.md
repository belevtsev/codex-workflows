# Go code clarity

Apply the project's established formatter and conventions to the requested files. Prefer changes that make control flow or ownership easier to understand; avoid unrelated formatting churn or comments that merely justify a style preference.

- Preserve nil-versus-empty behavior at serialization boundaries; a nil slice is valid Go and may be intentional.
- Use keyed struct literals when field order is not the API. Break long expressions at semantic boundaries, without changing short-circuit evaluation or shadowing.
- Reduce nesting where it clarifies failure paths. Named conditions should explain domain meaning, not hide order-sensitive work.
- An exported rename can break consumers; visibility and method sets are API decisions, not formatting.

Read [examples and detailed conventions](references/practices.md) only for the relevant clarity issue. [Conditional-expression and argument examples](references/details.md) expand the cases where a rewrite can obscure behavior. Repository and user conventions take precedence over these defaults.
