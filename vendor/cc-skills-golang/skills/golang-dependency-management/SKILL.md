# Go dependency resolution

Work from the actual module/workspace, selected Go toolchain, and pinned dependencies. Distinguish local replacements from published module resolution and version-selection rules from downloaded checksums.

- Keep `go.mod` and applicable `go.sum` changes reviewable. Dependency authorization covers the requested scope, not an unbounded `go get -u` upgrade.
- Use the standard library or an existing dependency when it meets the requirement. For a new choice, evaluate maintained APIs, compatibility, license, and meaningful security evidence.
- Inspect the selected version and transitive changes. Use `go mod tidy` when necessary to reconcile an authorized dependency edit, not for a read-only question.
- A `go.work` or `replace` can hide a consumer compatibility failure. Validate published resolution when the claim depends on it.
- Distinguish known package vulnerabilities from code paths reachable in this build. Required security gates remain required; ordinary module inspection is not a full audit.

Use [versioning and MVS](references/versioning.md), [conflict resolution](references/conflicts.md), [workspaces](references/workspaces.md), or [command examples](references/practices.md) for the task. Read [auditing](references/auditing.md), [automated updates](references/automated-updates.md), or [graph visualization](references/visualization.md) only when that workflow is requested or needed.
