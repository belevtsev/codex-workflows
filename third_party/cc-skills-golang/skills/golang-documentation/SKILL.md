# Go documentation

Write the documentation the task requests from the actual API, commands, and supported environment. Keep observed behavior separate from proposals and unverified examples. Reuse existing validation evidence; writing documentation does not itself require a new test campaign.

Explain caller obligations and observable behavior that signatures cannot show: ownership, lifetime, cancellation, errors, ordering, concurrency safety, and compatibility. Verify symbol names and command paths. Release notes describe effects on users without inflating a narrow fix.

Read only the needed format:

- [Code comments](references/code-comments.md): package/API comments, examples, deprecation.
- [Project documents](references/project-docs.md): README, CONTRIBUTING, changelog, delivery.
- [Library documentation](references/library.md) or [application documentation](references/application.md): audience-specific needs.
- [Examples and templates](references/practices.md): detailed samples and links to existing assets.

Add ancillary files, deployment setup, or generated documentation only when those deliverables are in scope. Templates are starting points, not a list of files every project must acquire.
