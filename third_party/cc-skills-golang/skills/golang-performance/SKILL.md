# Go performance changes

Start from the requested performance objective and evidence about the bottleneck. Separate CPU, allocation/GC, lock contention, I/O wait, and external-service latency before selecting an optimization.

Use comparable workloads, toolchains, hardware, concurrency, and warm/cold conditions. Change one causal factor at a time where practical, compare repeated measurements, and report uncertainty as well as the effect. Run competing benchmarks serially on shared hardware; parallel implementation does not make parallel measurement valid.

Preserve correctness, ownership, memory bounds, and cancellation. A cache needs explicit freshness/invalidation and capacity behavior; a pool must not leak state across users. Avoid runtime tuning that masks unbounded work.

Read [memory](references/memory.md), [CPU](references/cpu.md), [I/O](references/io-networking.md), [runtime](references/runtime.md), or [caching](references/caching.md) for the measured cause. [Measurement examples](references/practices.md) retain the investigation loop and [observability](references/observability.md) covers production signals. Use the benchmark specialist when comparison mechanics are needed. A plausible improvement is not a measured result.
