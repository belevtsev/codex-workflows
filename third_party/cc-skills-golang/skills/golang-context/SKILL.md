# Go context ownership

Propagate the caller's context through the request's services, storage, and external calls. Accept it explicitly, conventionally as `ctx context.Context`, and avoid replacing it with a background context inside a request path.

- Call the cancel function on every path unless its ownership is explicitly transferred.
- A deadline does not interrupt arbitrary work: blocking operations and loops must observe cancellation or have another bounded exit.
- Give work that must outlive a request a distinct owner, bounded lifetime, and shutdown path. `WithoutCancel` removes the inherited cancellation/deadline and is not a background-work supervisor.
- Context values carry request metadata using private key types, not required function parameters or hidden service dependencies.
- Context cancellation does not undo a committed external side effect. Preserve the acknowledgement and retry policy at that boundary.

Read [cancellation and deadlines](references/cancellation.md), [values and tracing](references/values-tracing.md), or [HTTP and service calls](references/http-services.md) for that part of the path. [Propagation examples](references/practices.md) illustrate the basic API shape.
