# Go types and interfaces

Design around the consumer's required behavior and the type's ownership. Keep established exported contracts unless an API change is requested.

- Extract interfaces where a consumer needs substitution or a stable contract; use the smallest useful method set. Preserve standard interface signatures.
- A typed nil stored in an interface is non-nil. Check assertions when a dynamic type is not guaranteed.
- Receiver choices affect method sets, copying, and mutation. Do not copy values containing synchronization state after use; a copied container can still share its underlying data.
- Embedding promotes methods and may unintentionally expose API or change interface satisfaction. A named field keeps forwarding explicit.
- Serialization tags and zero values are part of behavior. Preserve them when reorganizing fields or replacing `any` with a concrete or generic API.

Read [type design examples](references/practices.md) for method sets, embedding, compile-time checks, tags, generics, and copy prevention. Verify renames against reflection and external consumers as well as compiler-visible callers.
